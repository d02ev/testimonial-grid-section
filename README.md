## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS Custom Properties
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-First Workflow

### What I learned

Building this project I learned how to create an organized workflow, readable codes, good comments, using css variables, css imports, css grid and flexbox also a bit more about how to add a project on github efficiently.

- Adding Comments

```html
<!-- main section -->
<main>
  <!-- inner div section -->
  <div>
    Some HTML
  </div>
  <!-- inner div section ends -->
</main>
<!-- main section ends -->
```

```css
/* main class styling */
.main-class {
  color: papayawhip;
}
/* main class styling ends */
```

- CSS Variables

```css
* {
  --mainClassBG: someColor;
  --fontFam: someFontFamily;
}
```

- CSS Imports

```css
@import url("filename.css");
```

### Continued development

I need to focus upon efficient usage of **CSS Grid**, **Responsive Design**, **Dimensions** in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The official MDN Docs helped in acquiring the basic undestanding of CSS Grids and box-shadow properties.
